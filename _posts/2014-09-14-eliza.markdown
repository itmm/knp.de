I created a new [GitHub] project with [ELIZA]. It is based on a C version, that I found on the net. But I rewrote it, so you can now compile it with Clang without any errors or warning. Even if you set the warning level to `-pedantic`.

Basically I wrote this program for my daughter to rouse her interest in programming. It is fun to see, how little is needed to produce a program, that acts so smart.
